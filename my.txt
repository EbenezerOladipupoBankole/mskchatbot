About This Collection: Hymns—For Home and Church
The Lord has said, “My soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads” (Doctrine and Covenants 25:12). Sacred music can bring joy, comfort, and inspiration. Singing together can unify our families and congregations in faith and worship.

In advance of the publication of the new global hymnbook, Hymns—For Home and Church, we are pleased to release small groups of new hymns digitally. A new group of hymns will be released every few months until the full collection becomes available in print. New music will be selected from hymns composed by Latter-day Saints, hymns from other Christian traditions, and songs in the Church’s global sacred music library. These selections will include both hymns and children’s songs, all of which can be used at home, in sacrament meeting, and in other Church meetings.

We invite you to become familiar with the new music as it is released. Use these selections in your daily worship and gospel study and instruction, both at home and at church. Sheet music and audio recordings can be found on the Gospel Library and Sacred Music apps and at music.ChurchofJesusChrist.org. Training materials are also available to help members and leaders use the new music in their homes and congregations.

We thank the many members who have contributed their time, talents, and energy to this sacred music collection. May the Lord bless all of us as we offer to Him the songs of our hearts through sacred music.

New Hymns at Home
Sacred music can enhance gospel study and worship in your home, both individually and with your family. Learn how you can incorporate sacred music into your life and experience the blessings that come with it.


About the Hymns

Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing
English pastor and hymn writer Robert Robinson had a life-changing experience at age 16. One night he attended a religious revival meeting in London, not to worship, but to heckle the minister. He later wrote that he went to the meeting “to pity the folly of the preacher, the infatuation of the hearers, and to abhor the doctrine.” Instead, Robinson left the meeting changed, deeply convinced of his own sinfulness. In his early 20s, he became a preacher himself and wrote “Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing,” his powerful plea for God’s mercy and forgiveness.

This text was included in Emma Smith’s second hymn collection, published in Nauvoo in 1841. Like the original 1835 hymnal, the Nauvoo hymnal contained only texts, which could be sung with any tunes that matched their meter. “Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing” next appeared in the Church’s 1948 hymnal, paired with the American folk tune we know today. By 1985 it was not being sung frequently by members of the Church and was not included in Hymns (1985). Later an arrangement by Mack Wilberg, director of The Tabernacle Choir on Temple Square, created a new appreciation for the hymn, and “Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing” returned in Hymns—For Home and Church.

Principles
Jesus Christ made it possible for us to return home to God.

When we humbly turn to Him, Jesus Christ will change our hearts to align with God’s will.

Through the Lord’s grace and merciful help, we can overcome our fallen nature.

Questions to Ponder
Why does Jesus Christ deserve our endless expressions of gratitude and praise?

When have you felt God reaching out to rescue you?

When have your efforts to turn to God led you to feel His love and guidance?

Activities for Families
Teach what it means to “tune” your heart. Explain to your children that musical instruments need to be tuned to sound beautiful. When they’re out of tune, the music doesn’t sound right. Our hearts are similar—we need to tune them to God so we can feel His love and guidance.

You can demonstrate being in and out of tune by singing a few lines of the hymn or playing them on an instrument, first out of tune and then in tune. Invite your family to sing along. Talk about which way sounded better and why. Then talk about how to have a heart tuned to God. You might share examples of choices that can make our hearts out of tune or in tune with Him.

While playing the hymn in the background, pass around a small object. Occasionally pause the music. The person holding the object says one thing he or she can do to tune his or her heart to God that day.

Teach about being “prone to wander.” While on a walk with your children, explain that just as they need to stay on the path to reach their destination, we also need to stay on God’s path to return to live with Him. As you see things that could distract your children from where you are going, sing or talk about the line “Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I love.” Explain how easy it is to get distracted and wander. Ask your children how this is like our journey back to Heavenly Father. Remind them that we should do our best each day to stay on the path God has given us, but that even when we wander, He lovingly invites us back.


First Presidency Preface
Three months after the Church was organized, the Lord, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, instructed Joseph’s wife, Emma, to make a selection of sacred hymns for the Church: “For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads” (D&C 25:12).

Now, 150 years after the first hymnbook was published by the Church, we are pleased to present this revision. Many hymns found in our original hymnbook and in subsequent editions are included, as are a number of newly added hymns. All have been selected to meet the varied needs of today’s worldwide Church membership.

Music in Our Church Meetings
Inspirational music is an essential part of our church meetings. The hymns invite the Spirit of the Lord, create a feeling of reverence, unify us as members, and provide a way for us to offer praises to the Lord.

Some of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns. Hymns move us to repentance and good works, build testimony and faith, comfort the weary, console the mourning, and inspire us to endure to the end.

We hope to see an increase of hymn singing in our congregations. We encourage all members, whether musically inclined or not, to join with us in singing the hymns. We hope leaders, teachers, and members who are called on to speak will turn often to the hymnbook to find sermons presented powerfully and beautifully in verse.

Latter-day Saints have a long tradition of choir singing. Every ward and branch in the Church should have a choir that performs regularly. We encourage choirs to use the hymnbook as their basic resource.

Music in Our Homes
Music has boundless powers for moving families toward greater spirituality and devotion to the gospel. Latter-day Saints should fill their homes with the sound of worthy music.

Ours is a hymnbook for the home as well as for the meetinghouse. We hope the hymnbook will take a prominent place among the scriptures and other religious books in our homes. The hymns can bring families a spirit of beauty and peace and can inspire love and unity among family members.

Teach your children to love the hymns. Sing them on the Sabbath, in home evening, during scripture study, at prayer time. Sing as you work, as you play, and as you travel together. Sing hymns as lullabies to build faith and testimony in your young ones.

Music in Our Personal Lives
In addition to blessing us as Church and family members, the hymns can greatly benefit us as individuals. Hymns can lift our spirits, give us courage, and move us to righteous action. They can fill our souls with heavenly thoughts and bring us a spirit of peace.

Hymns can also help us withstand the temptations of the adversary. We encourage you to memorize your favorite hymns and study the scriptures that relate to them. Then, if unworthy thoughts enter your mind, sing a hymn to yourself, crowding out the evil with the good.

Brothers and sisters, let us use the hymns to invite the Spirit of the Lord into our congregations, our homes, and our personal lives. Let us memorize and ponder them, recite and sing them, and partake of their spiritual nourishment. Know that the song of the righteous is a prayer unto our Father in Heaven, “and it shall be answered with a blessing upon [your] heads.”

The First Presidency


Using the Hymnbook
The following material is intended to help you use the hymnbook effectively. Included are explanations of the elements of the hymnbook; discussions on using the hymns for congregations, choirs, and special groups; and information for beginning music directors, organists, and pianists.

Elements of the Hymnbook
Contents
The table of contents groups the hymns into eleven general categories. Hymns of similar subject and mood are generally found in the same section. However, being listed in a certain category should not limit the use of any hymn. For example, some hymns in the sacrament section, such as “How Great the Wisdom and the Love” and “I Stand All Amazed,” may be used for other purposes, and selected verses of several of the hymns in this section may be used for Easter. The index of topics will help you find hymns on specific subjects.

Mood and Tempo Markings
The mood markings, such as Prayerfully or Resolutely, suggest the general feeling or spirit of a hymn, although the mood of some hymns may vary according to the occasion or local preferences. Metronomic markings indicate a tempo range (such as
tempo range example
= 69–76) and are also given as general guidelines; the locale and context in which a hymn is used may suggest greater flexibility.

Introduction Brackets for Pianists and Organists
Brackets (
introduction marking
introduction marking
) on each hymn suggest a suitable piano or organ introduction. Before playing a hymn, scan it to make sure you see the complete introduction. You may want to highlight the brackets in your personal hymnbook, especially if the final phrase of an introduction does not happen to be at the end of the hymn.

You may also wish to shorten or lengthen the suggested introduction. If the hymn is unfamiliar, playing it completely through as an introduction can help the congregation feel more comfortable with it. If the hymn is well known, the last line or phrase may be a sufficient introduction. When using a short introduction, you may want to slow the tempo at the end to express a sense of completion.

Scriptural References
In early Christian tradition, most hymns were musical settings of adapted scriptural texts. Most of our current hymns relate to a number of scriptures; some of the many possibilities are listed at the end of each hymn. Using the Topical Guide and Index found in the Latter-day Saint edition of the scriptures, you will find many more verses of scripture that enrich the messages of our hymns.

Indexes
The hymnbook contains seven indexes with brief explanatory notes for each one: Authors and Composers; Titles, Tunes, and Meters; Tune Names; Meters; Scriptures; Topics; and First Lines and Titles.

Hymns for Congregations
Unison and Part Singing
Although part singing (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) has a strong tradition in the Church, the goal in congregational singing is that all participate, no matter what their vocal ability may be. Because many members sing the melody, regardless of their vocal range, the hymns are in keys that accommodate both unison and part singing. Some hymns—and parts of hymns—are specifically written for unison singing.

Selecting the Right Hymn
The hymns you select should reflect the general character of the meeting and help establish the proper spirit.

The opening hymn may be one of supplication or praise; it may express gratitude for the gospel, joy in being able to gather together, or enthusiasm for the work to be done.

The sacrament hymn should refer to the sacrament itself or to the sacrifice of the Savior.

An intermediate hymn provides an opportunity for congregational participation and may relate to the subject of the talks presented in the meeting. The congregation may stand during this hymn as appropriate.

The closing hymn is an opportunity for the congregation to respond to the spirit and content of the meeting.

Not every hymn is suitable for every Church-related occasion. Some hymns may be more appropriate for a youth gathering than for a sacrament meeting.

Selecting Verses to Be Sung
You need not feel compelled to sing all the verses of a hymn unless the message is otherwise incomplete. However, do not routinely shorten a hymn by singing just the first one or two verses. Singing the verses printed below the music is encouraged.

Achieving Balance in the Selection of Hymns
In addition to using hymns already known and loved, members are encouraged to become acquainted with new or less familiar hymns. Try to achieve a good balance between familiar favorites and less well-known hymns.

Hymns for Stake Conference
Standard, well-known hymns are often the best choice for stake conference, particularly if hymnbooks are not available for the entire congregation. Here are a few such hymns: “Come, Come, Ye Saints”; “Come, O Thou King of Kings”; “Come, Ye Children of the Lord”; “Count Your Blessings”; “Do What Is Right”; “Guide Us, O Thou Great Jehovah”; “High on the Mountain Top”; “How Firm a Foundation”; “I Am a Child of God”; “I Know That My Redeemer Lives”; “Let Us All Press On”; “Now Let Us Rejoice”; “Praise to the Man”; “Put Your Shoulder to the Wheel”; “Redeemer of Israel”; “Sweet Is the Work”; “The Spirit of God”; “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet.”

You may copy the hymns on a printed program unless the copyright restrictions on the hymn state that this is not permitted.

National Anthems
A few patriotic songs have been included in the hymnbook; with priesthood approval, local national anthems may be added. Members may stand for national anthems in church meetings, according to local custom and priesthood direction.

Hymns for Choirs and Special Groups
Using Hymns for Choirs
In this edition of the hymnbook no distinction is made between choir and congregational hymns. Choirs should use the hymnbook as their basic resource, selecting from the entire book. Choirs may also sing other appropriate anthems and hymn arrangements not included in the hymnbook.

Some of the hymns labeled “Choir” in previous hymnbook editions have been transposed to lower keys for greater congregational use. Choirs may want to keep copies of the past editions of the hymnbook to take advantage of higher keys and the possibility of modulating from one key to another. If only one copy of a previous edition is available, a hymn may be copied and used for this purpose, unless this is prohibited by the copyright notice.

Altering Hymns for Choir Performance
Hymns from the hymnbook, sung without variation, are always appropriate as choir selections. You may also vary your presentation of the hymns; however, use such variations sparingly, making sure they are consistent with the spirit of the hymn. Here are a few hymn adaptations you may wish to consider:

Have the men, the women, or both sing one verse in unison.

Have the congregation join the choir on the final verse or chorus of a hymn. (This is one way to help the congregation become more familiar with some of the hymns.)

Have the women sing one verse, as outlined below under “Hymns for Women’s Voices.”

Have the men sing one verse, as outlined below under “Hymns for Men’s Voices.”

Have the soprano and tenor sections sing a duet for one verse.

Have the tenors and basses sing the melody while the sopranos and altos sing the alto part.

Have one section of the choir sing the melody while the rest of the choir hums the other parts.

Hymns for Women’s Voices
In the women’s section of the book are hymns for women’s congregations and hymns that have been prepared for women’s choirs and trios. In addition, the sisters can sing without adaptation most of the other hymns in the book in two parts (soprano and alto) or in three parts (if the tenor part is not too low).

Hymns for Men’s Voices
The hymns in the men’s section of the book are divided into two categories: Men, for men’s congregations, and Men’s Choir, for choirs and quartets. For a congregational hymn in priesthood meeting, it is generally preferable to choose from the standard congregational hymns or from those marked Men.

Several hymns are specifically arranged for men’s choirs; in addition, many hymns for congregations and those marked Men can be adapted for use by men’s choirs and quartets:

Hymn showing what men sing
Baritones:
Sing melody

1st Tenors:
Sing alto above the melody

2nd Tenors:
Sing Tenor

Basses:
Sing Bass

The main problem in adapting hymns for a men’s choir is finding tenors who can sing as high as the alto may go; some high notes may need to be adapted. You may also transpose the hymn to a lower key, adapting the bass part.

For an example of an adaptation in the hymnbook, compare “Should You Feel Inclined to Censure” (no. 235), a congregational arrangement, with “Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy” (no. 335), the same music arranged for men’s voices.

Another possibility in adapting a hymn for a men’s choir is to have the alto part sung below the melody. When this is done, the bass part is optional.

You will note that in the hymns arranged for men’s choirs, a tenor clef symbol is used instead of the usual treble clef symbol. You should generally play the right-hand notes of these hymns an octave lower than the treble clef. The result is a rich, effective accompaniment for men’s voices.

For Beginning Music Directors
Measures, Time Signatures, and Downbeats
A measure is the smallest musical unit bordered by vertical lines:

Example of a musical measure
In the hymnbook, when a measure is carried over from one line of music to the next, the end of the first line is left open to show that the measure continues on to the next line:

measure on two lines
The time signature (two numbers, one above the other, such as
2/4
) is found at the beginning of each hymn. The top number indicates the number of beats or pulses in each measure. The bottom number tells what kind of note gets a beat or pulse. For example, a
3/4
time signature means there are three beats per measure in the hymn, and a quarter note (
a quarter note
) gets one beat.

As you direct the music, the first beat of your beat pattern (see beat pattern illustrations) should correspond with the first beat in each measure. This first beat, called the downbeat, is the strongest beat in each measure. You will note that many hymns begin on an upbeat, or pickup note, before the first downbeat.

Standard Beat Patterns
The purpose of beat patterns is to keep the congregation together rhythmically and to communicate the mood and spirit of the hymn. Patterns should be kept simple, but may vary according to the nature and mood of the hymn. The dots on the beat patterns show where the rhythmic pulses of the hymn occur.

A
6/8
or
6/4
hymn with a slow tempo, such as “Silent Night” (no. 204), may be conducted with either the traditional six-beat pattern or a double three-beat pattern—first a large one, followed by a smaller one:

alternative six-beat pattern
A
6/8
or
6/4
hymn with a moderate tempo, such as “Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd” (no. 221), may be conducted by omitting the second and fifth beats of the traditional six-beat pattern, and pausing at those points in the pattern:

another alternative six-beat pattern
A
6/8
or
6/4
hymn with a fast tempo, such as “Master, the Tempest Is Raging” (no. 105), may be conducted with a two-beat pattern—the first three beats go with the first stroke, and the last three beats go with the second stroke:

another alternative six-beat pattern
When using the last two beat patterns, be sure to keep the rhythm or pulses of the hymn constant.

Some Hymns That Are Easy to Conduct:
The two-beat pattern: “Come, Rejoice”; “Come, Thou Glorious Day of Promise”; “God Speed the Right”; and “Ye Who Are Called to Labor.”

The three-beat pattern: “Come, Follow Me”; “Do What Is Right”; “Glory to God on High”; “God, Our Father, Hear Us Pray”; “Teach Me to Walk in the Light.”

The four-beat pattern: “Abide with Me!”; “As I Search the Holy Scriptures”; “Come, Ye Children of the Lord”; “Did You Think to Pray?”; “For the Beauty of the Earth”; “Hark, All Ye Nations”; “Hope of Israel”; “We Will Sing of Zion.”

For Beginning Organists and Pianists
Adapting Hymn Accompaniments
Some hymns may have notes or passages that are difficult to play. Feel free to adapt such passages to your own ability by dropping less important notes from chords. You may want to mark your own hymnbook for this purpose.

Hymns frequently have a space between the tenor and bass notes that is too wide to reach with the left hand. Often the right hand can include the tenor note quite easily. You may want to mark such notes with a bracket to remind yourself to play them with your right hand:

tenor note marking
Some hymns and children’s songs are written with the piano in mind. If the organ is used for these songs, it is sometimes preferable to use manuals only, without pedals.

Cue Notes
A cue note, or small note, means that the note is optional. Following are examples of how cue notes may be used:

A cue note may indicate that the notes are to be played and sung with some verses and not with others, depending on the text of each verse:

cue note
Sometimes the music is complete even if the cue note is left out:

Cue notes may also indicate music to be played by the pianist or organist but not to be sung:

cue notes played by organist
Some Hymns That Are Easy to Play:
“Come, Follow Me”; “Do What Is Right”; “God Be with You”; “How Gentle God’s Commands”; “I Stand All Amazed”; “Keep the Commandments”; “Let the Holy Spirit Guide”; “Now Let Us Rejoice”; “Redeemer of Israel”; “Sweet Is the Work”; “Sweet Hour of Prayer”; “Teach Me to Walk in the Light”; “We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet.”

TOPICS
This index lists hymns according to topic. It may be useful in locating hymns suitable for a particular meeting, talk, or lesson. If you do not find the precise word you are looking for as a heading in the index, consider synonyms and other related words. Because of space limitations, this index is not intended to be comprehensive.
