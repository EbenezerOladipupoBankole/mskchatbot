      "Now weâll sing with one accord, For a prophet of the Lord, Bringing forth his precious word, Cheers the Saints as anciently. When the world in darkness lay, Lo! he sought the better way, And he heard the Savior say, âGo and prune my vineyard, son!â",
      "And an angel surely then, For a blessing unto men, Brought the priesthood back again In its ancient purity. Even Joseph he inspired; Yea, his heart he truly fired With the light that he desired For the work of righteousness.",
      "And the Book of Mormon true, With its covânant ever new, For the Gentile and the Jew, He translated sacredly. Godâs commandments to mankind, For believing Saints designed, And to bless the seeking mind, Came to him from Jesus Christ.",
      "Precious are the years to come, While the righteous gather home For the great millennium, When theyâll rest in blessedness. Prudent in this world of woes, They will triumph oâer their foes, While the realm of Zion grows Purer for eternity."

      "âJoseph, this is my Beloved; Hear him!â Oh, how sweet the word! Josephâs humble prayer was answered, And he listened to the Lord. Oh, what rapture filled his bosom, For he saw the living God, Oh, what rapture filled his bosom, For he saw the living God."

      "Once, when my scanty meal was spread, He entered; not a word he spake, Just perishing for want of bread. I gave him all; he blessed it, brake, And ate, but gave me part again. Mine was an angelâs portion then, For while I fed with eager haste, The crust was manna to my taste.",
      "I spied him where a fountain burst Clear from the rock; his strength was gone. The heedless water mocked his thirst; He heard it, saw it hurrying on. I ran and raised the suffârer up; Thrice from the stream he drained my cup, Dipped and returned it running oâer; I drank and never thirsted more.",
      "âTwas night; the floods were out; it blew A winter hurricane aloof. I heard his voice abroad and flew To bid him welcome to my roof. I warmed and clothed and cheered my guest And laid him on my couch to rest, Then made the earth my bed and seemed In Edenâs garden while I dreamed.",
      "Stript, wounded, beaten nigh to death, I found him by the highway side. I roused his pulse, brought back his breath, Revived his spirit, and supplied Wine, oil, refreshmentâhe was healed. I had myself a wound concealed, But from that hour forgot the smart, And peace bound up my broken heart.",
      "In prisân I saw him next, condemned To meet a traitorâs doom at morn. The tide of lying tongues I stemmed, And honored him âmid shame and scorn. My friendshipâs utmost zeal to try, He asked if I for him would die. The flesh was weak; my blood ran chill, But my free spirit cried, âI will!â",
      "Then in a moment to my view The stranger started from disguise. The tokens in his hands I knew; The Savior stood before mine eyes. He spake, and my poor name he named, âOf me thou hast not been ashamed. These deeds shall thy memorial be; Fear not, thou didst them unto me.â"

      "Glorious things are sung of Zion, Enochâs city seen of old, Where the righteous, being perfect, Walked with God in streets of gold. Love and virtue, faith and wisdom, Grace and gifts were all combined. As himself each loved his neighbor; All were one in heart and mind.",
      "There they shunnâd the powâr of Satan And observed celestial laws; For in Adam-ondi-Ahman Zion rose where Eden was. When beyond the powâr of evil, So that none could covet wealth, One continual feast of blessings Crownâd their days with peace and health.",
      "Then the towârs of Zion glittered Like the sun in yonder skies, And the wicked stood and trembled, Filled with wonder and surprise. Then their faith and works were perfect; Lo, they followed their great Head! So the city went to heaven, And the world said, âZionâs fled!â",
      "When the Lord returns with Zion, And we hear the watchman cry, Then weâll surely be united, And weâll all see eye to eye. Then weâll mingle with the angels, And the Lord will bless his own. Then the earth will be as Eden, And weâll know as we are known."

      "Like the sunbeams of morn on the mountains, The soul they awake to good cheer; Like the murmur of cool, pleasant fountains, They fall in sweet cadences near. Letâs oft, then, in kindly toned voices, Our mutual friendship renew, Till heart meets with heart and rejoices In friendship that ever is true. Oh, the kind words we give shall in memory live And sunshine forever impart. Let us oft speak kind words to each other; Kind words are sweet tones of the heart."

Into its shining corridors Our songs of praise weâll bring, For the heritage they left us, Not of gold or of worldly wealth, But a blessing everlasting Of love and joy and health. And we hear the desert singing: Carry on, carry on, carry on! Hills and vales and mountains ringing: Carry on, carry on, carry on! Holding aloft our colors, We march in the glorious dawn. O youth of the noble birthright, Carry on, carry on, carry on!"

Nature breathes her sweetest fragrance On the holy Sabbath day. Then away, haste away! Come away to the Sunday School! Then away, do not delay! Come away to the Sunday School!",
      "For a good and glorious purpose Thus we meet each Sabbath day, Each one striving for salvation Thru the Lordâs appointed way. Earnest toil will be rewarded; Zealous hearts need not repine. God will not withhold his blessings From the eager, seeking mind. Then away, haste away! Come away to the Sunday School! Then away, do not delay! Come away to the Sunday School!",
      "Let us then press boldly onward, Prove ourselves as soldiers true. He will lead us; he will guide us. Come, thereâs work for all to do, Never tiring, never doubting, Boldly struggling to the end. In the world, tho foes assail us, God will surely be our friend. Then away, haste away! Come away to the Sunday School! Then away, do not delay! Come away to the Sunday School!"
