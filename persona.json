The dawning of a brighter day, Majestic rises on the world.\n\nVerse 2:\nThe clouds of error disappear Before the rays of truth divine; The glory bursting from afar, Wide o'er the nations soon will shine."

The lyrics describe a return to former glory and blessings, accompanied by the presence and power of the Spirit, symbolized by fire and angelic visitation. The chorus emphasizes joyful celebration and praise to God in response to this spiritual renewal."
